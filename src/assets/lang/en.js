		content:
			"In the past, we couldn't accurately gauge how severe bike shortages were or allocate resources based solely on public feedback. To get a complete picture, we analyzed data from all stations. We first identified stations with critical shortages during peak hours (7-9 AM and 5-7 PM), and then, by the end of May, added 1,780 bikes to those stations. This increased bike availability by an average of about 16%, effectively easing bike shortages.",
